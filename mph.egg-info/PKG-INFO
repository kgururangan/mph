MPH, or Many-Particle Holstein is essentially just a Python translation of the exciton1D 
code written by Nicholas Hestand (https://github.com/nicholashestand/exciton1d). The code
constructs and diagonalizes the Frenkel-Holstein Hamiltonian for a molecular aggregate
in the basis of 1- and 2-particle excitonic states, and uses the resulting eigenvalues
and eigenvectors to compute the absorption spectrum. In the future, I plan on adding
a few things, including a PDF showing derivations for all matrix elements, 3-particle and higher
terms, and higher-order spectroscopy simulations, such as pump-prope and 2D electronic spectroscopy.
